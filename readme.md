![Hill Defence](./res/about.png)

This game is a tower defence game. The player controls a tower which is placed on a terrain. The tower can shoot at enemies and deal damage to them.

## Requirements

Unity 2019.4.1f1

- WASD : basic movement
- SHIFT : Makes camera accelerate
- Mouse : Mouse look
- Scroll wheel : Height over terrain
- mouse click right: set lock/unlock movement 
- mouse click left: Show the tower to place it on the terrain (The tower is painted in the color of the team of the nearest tower, if it is far from the tower it will be painted black and cannot be instantiated.)
- mouse double click left: Placing the tower on the terrain.
- M : Show/hide minimap.
  
## Implemented

* Team flags are randomly generated on the ground, through an algorithm, at a minimum distance from each other.

* The colours of each team are generated through an array of colours. This is applied to the flag and the soldiers.

* The nearest flag is set as the enemy of each team.

* Soldiers are generated around the flag, taking into account that there is a minimum distance between them.

* The soldiers aim to destroy the enemy flag, but if they encounter enemies in their attack range, they will try to destroy them.

* Soldiers and flags have a number of hits to be destroyed.

* Place turrets to defend a flag.

* Improve the soldiers AI, take into account the soldiers of other teams.

* add minimap on keypress M
  
* Improve the initial and find enemy performance 

## TO DO

* Improve the movement of soldiers to avoid colliding with turrets.

* Improve the soldiers AI, who are under attack, as well as defend the flag when it is under attack.

* Show the percentage of available health for each soldier.

* Create a UI with information about the game and the winner.
